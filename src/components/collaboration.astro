      <p class="font-hindlight">
        Joint Campaigns is a very effective way to start the journey of
        collaboration. While participating into a campaign, 3-5 businesses
        spotlights their offer. All businesses. post on their social media and
        engage in othersâ€™ posts. This widens your visibility, builds authority
        and creates momentum. The result is growth!

      <h3 class="font-hindmedium text-xl my-4 font-bold">New markets & opportunities</h3>
      <p class="font-hindlight">
        During joint campaigns, we get to know the other entrepreneurs. This
        allows us to identified our alignement, build trust and explore further
        collaborations. Where applicable, this could look like a new special
        offer crated together, cross-selling and affiliate marketing or joining
        forces in tenders.

      <h3 class="font-hindmedium text-xl my-4 font-bold">Increasing Buying Power</h3>
      <p class="font-hindlight">
        Active collaboration can also be explored by identifying expenses that
        match and can be optimised. An example could be sharing the expense of a
        market stool and sell multiple lines, it can be of logistical nature,
        packing, 3PL etc or other ways to increse buying power. Together we can
        get a better price.
