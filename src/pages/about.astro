            Hello beautiful people!

            My name is Manu.

          <p class="font-hindlight md:w-96">
            I’m the founder of the EmpowerMe Collective. And yes, I am guilty! I
            am a repeated offender - this is not the first Collective!!!

            The first time it was after connecting with a person I met at a
            course. We clicked immediately and agreed to meet again over a
            coffee. Time passed by and when we did indeed meet, we had one of
            those beautifully deep conversations! We bounced off each other and
            totally lost track of time. One moment it was early afternoon and
            the next, it was getting darker and colder.
          </p>
          <p class="font-hindlight md:w-96">
            We both wondered why was it not possible to have such good
            conversations more often?

            In the coming days and weeks we put together the concept, found a
            location and spread the word. We quickly realised that we were not the only ones wanting to skip
            small talk for greater connections.
          </p>

          <p class="pt-3 font-hindlight">
            The collective boomed and we open up additional groups. These went on for over 3 years. And some of us still meet
            today.
