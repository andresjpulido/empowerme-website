        The EmpowerMe Masterclass is taking participants through a journey to
        identify some of the inner blocks and making those invisible stories
        visible. It then leverages the transformational power of habits to
        become the version of ourselves that will take participants to their
        desired outcomes.

        Habits hold immense power for they can change the way we see ourselves.
        And if we change how we view ourselves, we change what we believe is
        possible, and that’s transformational.

        Case study: A story I am particularly proud of
      </h2>
      <p class="font-hindlight pb-4">
        When I first created the course “The Transformation power of habits”, I
        shared it with my sister. I did so because she was in the process of
        writing her third book (please note, the process is transferable to any
        challenging area in our lives). She was complaining on how stretched she
        was with her busy schedule and as a result procrastinating on her
        writing. This led her to feel super stressed as the looming deadline was
        putting her under immense pressure yet still continuing to procrastinate
        and self-sabotaging herself.
      </p>
      <p class="font-hindlight pb-4">
        My beautiful sister took the formula shared in this masterclass and
        boom, she published an incredible book in record time and said:
      </p>
      <p class="font-hindlight pb-4">
        “I've always found it difficult to develop a routine, and I've viewed my
        life as a "creative mess." At the end of the day, when I had a deadline,
        I'd always find a way to finish my piece on time and it would be well
        done. However, this always occurred at the last minute, leaving me
        completely exhausted and drained. I often wondered why was I doing that
        to me and how to change it. [...]
      </p>
      <p class="font-hindlight pb-8 leading-loose">
        It was mind blowing for me to realise how fast we can change and how
        less stressful my life can become. I've started to use the hacks I
        learned for everything and the results are phenomenal. I genuinely adore
        this course and highly recommend it!”
