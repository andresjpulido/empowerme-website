        The choices we make and the path we create for ourselves are heavily
        influenced by the environment we come from, which also dictates our
        beliefs and the self-limitations we impose on ourselves. The ‘stories we
        tell ourselves’ offer beliefs that can mask our true potential and
        authentic selves and hinder our progress making us play small.

        The EmpowerMe Garden bring the collective together to identify some of
        the inner blocks that have been holding them back in starting/running a
        successful business and making those invisible stories visible. It then
        leverages the transformational power of habits to become the version of
        ourselves that will take participants to their desired outcomes.

          Why EMPOWER ME Collective?
        </h2>
        <p class="font-hindlight pb-4">
          For the simple desire for deeper conversations and really connecting
          with a tribe that is on the same journey! The additional perk to it is
          developing a growth mindset that will help us be better people, run
          better businesses and live better lives.
        </p><p class="font-hindlight pb-8">
          Our inner blocks play a part in the way we are and what we do (or
          don’t do), and therefore the way we run our business. It can influence
          the decisions we make and play a major part in the consistency or
          inconsistencies of our income levels, fast-tracking or slowing our
          business growth, shaping our efficiency and use of resources or time
          management.

      commitment and brought in only benefits.

          When a story comes from people I can relate to, it lands way more
          strongly. Suddenly it is not something that an incredible coach did or
          said to do, making me question whether I have it in me...and possible
          confirming those stories are true.
