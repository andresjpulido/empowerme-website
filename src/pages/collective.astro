        The choices we make and the path we create for ourselves are heavily
        influenced by the environment we come from, which also dictates our
        beliefs and the self-limitations we impose on ourselves. The ‘stories we
        tell ourselves’ offer beliefs that can mask our true potential and
        authentic selves and hinder our progress making us play small.

        The EmpowerMe Garden bring the collective together to identify some of
        the inner blocks that have been holding them back in starting/running a
        successful business and making those invisible stories visible. It then
        leverages the transformational power of habits to become the version of
        ourselves that will take participants to their desired outcomes.

          For the simple desire for real conversations and  connecting with fellow entrepreneurs that are on the same journey!

          Your inner blocks play a part in the way you are and what you do (or don’t do), and therefore the way you run your business. It can influence the decisions you make  and play a major part in the consistency or inconsistencies of your income levels, fast-tracking or slowing your business growth, shaping your efficiency and use of resources and time.

      About the EmpowerMe Collective
    </h2>
    <p class="font-hindlight pb-8">
      The best part of any coaching is the tribe of fellow travellers you meet,
      the deep conversations you have and the strong connections you make. Here
      we've extrapolated that part without the significant financial or time
      commitment and brought in only benefits.

          The ‘stories we tell ourselves’ offer beliefs that can mask our true
          potential and authentic selves and hinder our progress making us play

          When a story comes from people I can relate to, it lands way more
          strongly. Suddenly it is not something that an incredible coach did or
          said to do, making me question whether I have it in me...and possible
          confirming those stories are true.
